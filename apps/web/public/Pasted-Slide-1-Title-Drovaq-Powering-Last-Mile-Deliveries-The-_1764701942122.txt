The Operating System for Dispatch Companies

Slide 2
The Problem

When a dispatch company grows beyond 10 to 20 bikes, operations break.
We experienced this firsthand while building Cartway.

Common operational questions include:

How do I automatically receive and assign deliveries
How do customers track their deliveries in real time
How do I handle payments and confirmations
How do I manage customer inventory
How do I reconcile inventory payments especially POD
How do I manage my fleet
How do I manage fleet inventory
How do I scale operations without confusion
How do I manage everything end to end

The truth is simple.
Most dispatch companies cannot scale because their systems cannot scale.

Slide 3
The Insight

The struggle is not caused by riders.
It is caused by fragmented tools and lack of visibility.

At scale:

Processes become manual
Revenue leakages grow
Fraud becomes easier
Inventory becomes disorganised
Customer experience becomes inconsistent
Owners lose visibility and control

We needed one system that handles everything in one place.
